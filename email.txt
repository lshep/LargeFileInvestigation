Dear Package Maintainer,

We have identified remnants of large files inside your repository. This is
problematic as Bioconductor explores alternative routes for hosting package
source code and build products.

This is a result of a large file at one point being checked into git. The file
has since been removed by you but the historical reference of the large file
remains in the git history as a hidden `.git/pathtofile` reference. We will
perform the necessary steps to clean the git history of the large file
remnants. We will do this for you as it will also require a force push against
the current git repository which only current Bioconductor Core Team members can
perform on git.bioconductor.org.

Using a `git -force` will invalidate any local checkouts of the
repository. Anyone that has previously checked out the git.bioconductor.org
respository should either reclone or would need to perform a `git reset --hard`
followed by a `git pull` against the Bioconductor remote and branch.

If there are any concerns or further questions please reach out to
maintainer@bioconductor.org

Thank you.




Dear Package Maintainer,

We have identified large files inside your repository. This is problematic as
Bioconductor explores alternateive routes for hosting package source code and
build products.

Large files should be removed from the package and distributed through other
means such as hosting on zenodo and using ExperimentHub or BiocFileCache or
other caching mechanisms to control the download.  
Failure to remove the large files will result in your package being deprecated
and removed from Bioconductor.
