Dear Package Maintainer,

We have identified remnants of large files inside your repository. This is
problematic as Bioconductor explores alternative routes for hosting package
source code and build products.

This is a result of a large file at one point being checked into git. The file
has since been removed by you but the historical reference of the large file
remains in the git history. We will perform the necessary steps to clean the git
history of the large file remnants. We will do this for you as it will also
require a force push against the current git repository which only current
Bioconductor Core Team members can perform on git.bioconductor.org.

Using a `git -force` will invalidate any local checkouts of the
repository. Anyone that has previously checked out the git.bioconductor.org
respository should either reclone or would need to perform a `git reset --hard`
followed by a `git pull` against the Bioconductor remote and branch.


You can see the files by either running

git rev-list --objects --all |
      git cat-file --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname) %(objectsize) %(rest)' |
      grep '^blob' |
      awk -v repo= '$3 > 100000000 {printf "%s\t%.2f MB\t%s\n", repo, $3/1024/1024, $4}' |
      sort -k2 -nrsophie.wind@uni-muenster.de

and/or

find . -type f -size +100M


We will begin to clean repositories Novemeber 1st and will contact you when we
have performed the action on your package. If there are any concerns or further
questions  please reach out to maintainer@bioconductor.org before November 1.

Thank you.




Dear Package Maintainer,

We have identified large files inside your repository. This is problematic as
Bioconductor explores alternative routes for hosting package source code and
build products.

Large files should be removed from the package and distributed through other
means such as hosting on zenodo and using ExperimentHub or BiocFileCache or
other caching mechanisms to control the download.  
Failure to remove the large files will result in your package being deprecated
and removed from Bioconductor. You have until Bioc 3.23 release (normally late
March/April) to make required changes. 

Some helpful links:

You can see the files by either running

git rev-list --objects --all |
      git cat-file --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname) %(objectsize) %(rest)' |
      grep '^blob' |
      awk -v repo= '$3 > 100000000 {printf "%s\t%.2f MB\t%s\n", repo, $3/1024/1024, $4}' |
      sort -k2 -nrsophie.wind@uni-muenster.de

and/or

find . -type f -size +100M


After large files are removed you will need to reach out to the Bioconductor
Core Team to assist with the reset on git.bioconductor.org as it will require a
force push that only the Core Team has access to do.


If there are any concerns or further questions please reach out to
maintainer@bioconductor.org

Thank you.
